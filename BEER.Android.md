# The Beer Test

<sub>(Don't speak `Android`? Try `iOS`(link pending) instead!)</sub>

So you cracked a cold one with the boys...

Let's set the scene. You've been working on a project desperately in need of a robust and accurate positioning system, yet you haven't been able to find a reliable one. Lucky for you, a friend of yours tipped you off a while back on an excellent library, and in you're half-inebriated state, your outstanding judgement dictates that now's the time to give that library a shot. With half a mind ready to start, you pull out your computer and set aside your now (mysteriously) half-empty beer.

You pull out all the tools you need:
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* An Android mobile device
* An internet connection
* The magic Key of Development (which can be obtained from *here(link pending)*)

Then you start a new Android Studio project.
